# EcoForecast-Predicting-CO2-Emissions-in-Energy-Production

# Project Overview

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate the process of forecasting CO2 emissions from power generation using coal and natural gas. The goal is to utilize time series analysis techniques to predict future CO2 emissions, providing valuable insights into environmental impacts and helping in policy making and energy management.

# Repository Structure

Prediction-Coal.ipynb: Focuses on forecasting CO2 emissions from coal-powered generation.
Prediction-NaturalGas.ipynb: Dedicated to forecasting CO2 emissions from natural gas-powered generation.
Each notebook follows a structured approach detailed below.

# Data Handling and Preprocessing

Data Retrieval: Time series data for CO2 emissions is loaded from CSV files.
Data Cleaning: Missing values are imputed, and data types are corrected to ensure consistency in time series data. Anomalies and outliers are handled appropriately to improve model accuracy.
Visualization: Initial data exploration includes plotting the CO2 emission trends over time to identify patterns and anomalies.

# Time Series Analysis

Stationarity Testing: The time series data is tested for stationarity using visual and statistical methods (ADF Test).
Making Series Stationary: Techniques such as moving averages and differencing are applied to transform the time series into a stationary series.

# Model Development

SARIMA Model Building: The Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model is used. Parameters for the SARIMA model are determined using a grid search approach that evaluates various combinations for optimal performance.
Model Diagnostics: Residuals from the SARIMA model are checked to ensure no patterns are left unmodeled.
Validation and Forecasting: The modelâ€™s predictive accuracy is validated using historical data, and forecasts are made for future emissions.
# Results

The notebooks visualize the forecasts against actual emissions to assess the model's performance.
Performance metrics such as AIC and BIC are provided to quantify the model fit.
# Usage

Users can run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
The data files must be placed in the specified directory, or paths in the notebooks should be adjusted accordingly.
 # Requirements

Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, itertools, warnings.

# Conclusions

The models provide a reliable method for predicting future CO2 emissions based on historical data.
Insights derived from these forecasts can aid in understanding the impact of different energy sources on environmental health.

# Future Work

Incorporating additional predictors such as economic indicators or energy prices to improve model accuracy.
Expanding the analysis to include more diverse sources of energy production.
Deploying the model into a web-based dashboard for real-time forecasting and analysis.
